# StockSherlock
  
  A wise man once said: "It's elementary my dear Watson!" The same thing can be said about stock trade and comparison.
  Stock Sherlock uses the NASDAQ Data On Demand API to process EndOfDayData.xml files and convert them into monthly data snapshots in the
  form of numpy arrays that are modeled under our metrics: Variability Mean, Growth Rate, Volume Mean, Volume Spread, and Risk. This data
  is condensed and converted into a .csv file that IBM Watson's Tradeoff Analytics API displays in a stock comparison visualization tool.
  
## Dependencies
  The following `pip` packages must be installed for the backend to function properly.
  * Flask
  * Requests
  * io
  * pandas
